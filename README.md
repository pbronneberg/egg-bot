# Why did I create this?

I wanted to show how open-source hardware and software can be used to create "useful" items within days.

.. And I was entering an egg-painting challenge at work 🤓

---

# Inspiration

The egg-bot is to resemble the [JJRobots Sphere-o-bot](https://www.jjrobots.com/sphere-o-bot-jjrobots-version/) where possible..

But adapted to limit 3D printing time, and working on hardware already available in my parts bin.

## JJRobots Sphere-o-bot

The accuracy of the sphere-o-bot is the goal. But the printing time (20+ hrs for base) is more than intended, and the code is based on Arduino Zero (Cortex M0+).

## ZDV Sphere-o-bot

Arduino leonardo + CNC board based. Base is slimmed down, reducing printing time to +-9 hours on 0.2mm smooth settings.

**Note:** [Youtube shots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=657EUCRkJw4) suggest plotting accuracy is far lower than the JJRobots version (could this be driver tuning / software?).
